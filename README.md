# Interior-Point-Method
This is a repository for prototyping the Interior Point Method for a general non-linear objective and (In)equality constraints. You can add your new test problems in the objF.m, Ceq.m, CIneq.m by introducing the function, gradient, and Hessian definitions and modify the Model.m to activate your problem.
